# Instructions


## Task 
You will be leading a demo of a "Silent Disco" meeting, an asynchronous learning session where attendees working through a digital methods tutorial have the opportunity to receive real-time support through Microsoft Teams chat.

One person will act as the instructor and will be responsible for welcoming attendees, initialising the chat session, fielding questions, and closing the workshop. For the purposes of the demo, everyone else will act as a "helper" who can assist the instructor in responding to questions.
  
The instructor should feel comfortable with the Microsoft Teams chat interface. The helpers will assist in answering questions, but will have fewer facilitating duties.
  
First, you'll want to assign instructor/helper roles to each group member. Then, open the Colab notebook [following the instructions in the repo](https://github.com/DCS-training/IntroToTextAnalysis). This notebook contains the tutorial for the workshop, so you'll want to familiarise yourself with the lesson in order to prepare for answering questions.
  
Silent Disco workshops are appropriate for all skill levels, so be prepared to provide varying levels of support to attendees. 
  
## Time
You will have 30 minutes to prepare for the workshop demo. The demo itself will last for 20 minutes followed by 10 minutes for a brief feedback discussion.

## Pre-workshop email  

Attendees have received the following message preparing them for the workshop:  
  
"Dear All,     

I am writing as you are a registered participant in the upcoming training: Silent Disco. Intro to Text Analysis  

 The session will take place in Silent disco mode Thursday (30/03) from 10:00 to 12:00.

Please carefully read the following notes regarding how to get ready and connect to the online class.    

This is a Silent Disco mode event. To access this event, you will need to sign up to this Teams Team in advance. For this event, we are not going to use the video function of teams but only the chat. Once you have joined the group you will be able to ask questions in a live thread or by creating a new one by selecting "New conversation" 

If you're new to this training event format, or to CDCS training events in general, read more on what to expect from CDCS training. Here you will also find details of our cancellation and no-show policy, which applies to this event.  

This Silent Disco is based on this Tutorial developed by Edina for CDCS. You can start going through it at any point, but your instructor will be available to deal with any queries during the scheduled time of the workshop (10:00 -- 12:00) and will be available to respond to any queries in the days following via email.  

Please let us know if you have any questions. 

Best Wishes,  

The CDCS Team"

## Tips and advice:

- At the beginning of the workshop, welcome attendees and point them to the Colab notebook. Remind them of the goal of the workshop and give a brief overview of its structure.
- Some attendees may have difficulty opening the notebook, so make sure you're familiar with how to do this before you begin.
- When responding to questions, avoid potentially discouraging language (e.g. "This is simple/easy/straightforward..." or "you should have no trouble at all..."). Many learners from non-digital backgrounds have significant anxiety about their computational skills, and have likely encountered the "born-programmer" myth. It's therefore important to create a supportive environment where making mistakes is part of the learning process.
- Halfway through the workshop, you might want to ask how everyone is getting on and remind them that you're available for another X minutes to answer any questions.  
- At the end of the workshop, let attendees know that you're logging off, but that they will have access to all workshop materials, including the Github and Teams group, after the session concludes. 



## Feedback
After participating in the Silent Disco, attendees are invited to submit their feedback on the experience through an online form. The results can be used to gauge areas for improvement for future workshops and also provide insight on the effectiveness of the lesson. At the end of the workshop, you'll want to point attendees to the form and encourage them to submit their feedback.
