# Instructions


## Task 
You will be leading a demo of a standard workshop. Ideally, one person (but two people may "team-teach" if desired) will act as the instructor and everyone else will act as helpers.  
  
The instructor will introduce and lead the live coding lesson, which attendees will access through Google Colab. The helpers will provide real-time support to attendees who run into errors.  
  
To facilitate problem solving without disrupting the workshop, attendees will use a flag system with sticky notes to ask for help. You will need to instruct them in this process (see the "Tips" section for some ideas on how to do so). At any point during the workshop, attendees with errors or questions can place the red sticky note on their computers to signal to the helpers that they need assistance.  

The group member acting as the instructor should feel comfortable leading a tutorial, responding to questions, and facilitating discussion. The helpers will primarily be acting in supportive roles, and should feel comfortable moving about the room and assisting attendees face-to-face.  

First, you'll want to assign instructor/helper roles to each group member. Then, open the Google Colab notebook [provided in the repo](https://github.com/DCS-training/DHRSE_SummerSchool_CDCS/blob/main/Standard_Workshop/Instructors_Helpers_Material/text_analysis_extract.ipynb). This notebook will be used for the live coding session, which is the main activity for the workshop.  

During the workshop, the instructor will introduce themselves and get to know the attendees before proceeding through the lesson. As they progress through the lessson, instructor(s) will explain each line of code to the attendees and provide opportunities for questions, discussion, and problem-solving.  
## Time
You will have 30 minutes to prepare for the workshop demo. The demo itself will last for 20 minutes followed by 10 minutes for a brief feedback discussion.

## Pre-workshop email  

Attendees have received the following message preparing them for the workshop:  
  
"Good afternoon,

You have registered as a participant for the upcoming course: Text Analysis with Python’s NLTK Library.

The course will start Monday 10/04 from 14:00-15:00 and will last Monday 01/05.

Please carefully read the following notes regarding how to get ready for this course

If you’re new to this training event format, or to CDCS training events in general, read more on what to expect from CDCS training. Here you will also find details of our cancellation and no-show policy, which applies to this event.

The course will take place in the Digital Scholarship Centre Room. The room is located on the last floor of the Library. If you are accessing the 6th floor by the elevator the room will be located on your left past the wooden door.

As of March 2022, the government formally removed all Covid restrictions in the UK. We ask that you continue to be considerate of others’ personal space, and please do not attend if you feel unwell or have any of Covid symptoms.

For this course, the instructor is going to use Python via Google Colab.

If you are going to use Google Colab you do not need to install anything but you will need to set up on it up. Attached is the instruction on how to do so.

In the attached document there is also info on how to download Python via Anaconda and how to set it up in Noteable. Please notice that if you decide to use Noteable or run the notebook on your own machine you may encounter some problems in installing the libraries.

To share the course material and facilitate communications we have created a Teams Group. Please join the Teams via this link.
All material will be shared via Teams in the “Files” tab of the “General” channel (you will not be able to access the materials without joining).
We are going to share the Google Colab link in the Team group on Thursday.

Best wishes,

The CDCS Team"

## Tips and advice:

- At the start of the workshop, explain the use of the sticky notes to attendees. (red=need help with an issue, green=no issues and ready to proceed)
  - For helpers: your primary job during the lesson will be providing support for attendees with questions/issues. Don't forget to scan the room for red stickies!
  - For instructors: it's a good idea to slow down when you're noticing lots of red stickies. You can also ask attendees to use the sticky system at regular intervals throughout the lesson (e.g. "Let's check everyone is     ready to move on. Please place the red sticky on your computer if you need some help, or the green sticky if you're all set.")
- Before beginning, make sure that everyone has the notebook open.
  - This is a good trial for the sticky note system. Ask attendees to place the red sticky on their computer if they have an issue accessing the notebook, and the green sticky when they have opened it successfully.
- Take note of any tool-specific instructions and share these with your helpers ahead of time. For instance, in this workshop, the NLTK downloader will ask for several user inputs. Attendees will need to type 'd' to initialise the download, then 'a' to download the packages, and 'q' to quit after the download is complete.
- Make sure that attendees have successfully followed any specific instructions before proceeding (another good opportunity for the sticky system!)
- To facilitate peer support, group the attendees by mixed skill levels. One way to do this is to ask attendees introduce themselves by talking a bit about their digital backgrounds and their experience with the particular tool/method.
- You might also discuss your own experience, especially if you have a similar background to that of attendees. 
- Remember general presentation skills: make sure the font (especially in the console!) is big enough, slides are designed for accessbility, and that you follow the attendees' pace.
- Avoid potentially discouraging language (e.g. "This is simple/easy/straightforward..." or "you should have no trouble at all..."). Many learners from non-digital backgrounds have significant anxiety about their computational skills, and have likely encountered the "born-programmer" myth. It's important to create a supportive environment where making mistakes is part of the learning process.
-  Regularly invite discussion and opportunities to provide clarity (e.g. "Why do you think we encountered this error? Discuss your thoughts with your table." and "What questions do we have at this time?")
- When introducing a method or tool, ask attendees to consider how they might apply the technique in their own work, perhaps by sharing a specific dataset with which they are working in a table discussion.


## Feedback
After participating in a standard workshop, attendees are invited to submit their feedback on the experience through an online form. The results can be used to gauge areas for improvement for future workshops and also provide insight on the effectiveness of the lesson. At the end of the workshop, you'll want to point attendees to the form and encourage them to submit their feedback.
