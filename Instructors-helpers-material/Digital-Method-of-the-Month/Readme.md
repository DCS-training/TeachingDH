# Instructions


## Task 
You will be leading a demo of a "Digital Method of the Month" meeting, a space to freely discuss the practicalities of learning and implementing a new digital skill in research context. DMM sessions take place on Teams and so you will be simulating the workshop as an online discussion.

One person will act as the main facilitator and will be responsible for leading the meeting, fielding questions, and structuring discussion. Everyone else will act in supporting roles as members of the expert panel to answer attendees' questions about the method.  
  
The group member leading the meeting should feel comfortable with the organising and speaking roles required. The helpers will also contribute to discussion and will answer questions, but will have fewer facilitating duties.

First, you'll want to assign facilitator/helper roles to each group member. Then, open the DMM notebook [provided in the repo](https://github.com/DCS-training/Digital-Method-of-the-Month/blob/main/DMM%20Docs/Text%20Analysis.md). This notebook will be used to guide discussion during the meeting. You might want to prepare an outline or general overview of what you will discuss (and in what order). For instance, it could be helpful for the facilitator and the helpers to start by introducing themselves and briefly discussing their expertise with the tool/method.


DMM meetings are appropriate for absolute beginners, and many of the attendees might have limited experience with digital research. However, you'll want to get to know attendees in order to tailor the discussion to their familiarity with the method. Ask attendees to introduce themsleves and share a bit about their experience with digital research (and, if applicable, text analysis). It might also be interesting to have them explain why they signed up for the meeting and how they might apply text analysis in their own research. Attendees who have prior experience of text analysis might share this with their peers during the discussion. 
  
## Time
You will have 30 minutes to prepare for the workshop demo. The demo itself will also last for 30 minutes.

## Pre-workshop email  

Attendees have received the following message preparing them for the workshop:  
  
"Dear All,

You are receiving this email as you are a registered participant in the upcoming training event:

Digital Method of the Month: Text Analysis

The event will take place on the 03rd of April at 12:00.

Please carefully read the following notes on how to prepare for the online session.

We are going to use a Team channel. To access this event, you will need to sign up to this Teams Team in advance.

Once you have joined the Group you will be able to see the link to join the discussion on Monday.

The group will remain online for the rest of the semester to give you a space where to contact people for help and share any resources others may find useful.

If you want to familiarise yourself with the good practices of using text analysis in research, you can have a look at our Pathway of Learning in Text Analysis

During the meeting, we are going to use this shared document to discuss and it will remain available afterwards for you to use.

If youâ€™re new to this training event format, or to CDCS training events in general, read more on what to expect from CDCS training.

Here you will also find details of our cancellation and no-show policy, which applies to this event.

Let us know if you have any questions.

Best Wishes,

The CDCS Team"

## Tips and advice:

- Prepare some talking points and things to focus on during the meeting, but don't feel like you have to address every point in the notebook. Attendees will have access to all workshop materials, including the Github and Teams group, after the session concludes.
- Remind attendees that they might not have many questions until they get started with text analysis in their own time. If appropriate, you may invite attendees to drop you (and the helpers) a line if they run into problems in the future.
- Before beginning, make sure that everyone has the notebook open. Remind them of the structure of the workshop and give a brief overview of what you will cover.
- Remember general presentation skills: make sure the font (especially in the console!) is big enough, visuals are designed for accessbility, and that you follow the attendees' pace.
- Avoid potentially discouraging language (e.g. "This is simple/easy/straightforward..." or "you should have no trouble at all..."). Many learners from non-digital backgrounds have significant anxiety about their computational skills, and have likely encountered the "born-programmer" myth. It's therefore important to create a supportive environment where making mistakes is part of the learning process.
- Regularly invite discussion and opportunities to provide clarity (e.g. "What questions do we have at this time?")
- Emphasise knowledge transfer by asking attendees to consider how they might apply text analysis in their own work. This could be a good opportunity for large-group discussion and brainstorming.


## Feedback
After participating in the DMM, attendees are invited to submit their feedback on the experience through an online form. The results can be used to gauge areas for improvement for future workshops and also provide insight on the effectiveness of the lesson. At the end of the workshop, you'll want to point attendees to the form and encourage them to submit their feedback.
