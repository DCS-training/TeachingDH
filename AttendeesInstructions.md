# Attendees Instructions
 During the activity, you will act as an attendee for two of the three training types. 
 
 Please read the material below to familiarise yourself with the information an attendee would have received. 

## 1. Standard Training. "Text Analysis with Python’s NLTK Library"
### 1.1 Structure 
Courses are longer training events (usually two to five classes) and they are the most time-consuming type of training offered by the Centre. 

Please make sure you have the time to attend all the classes. 

There may be some preparation to do between classes and you will most likely be asked to install some software/packages beforehand. 

All the instructions on how to prepare will be sent to you by email prior to the first meeting. 

Our courses will run either in person or online. 

For the courses, we use the Team feature in Microsoft Teams, so you may be asked to join a Team in advance of the course in order to contact and get support from your instructor and to facilitate the sharing of the course material.

### 1.2 Training Page content

**IN PERSON**

This course is for people who have some experience coding in Python and would like to expand their capabilities to include the library Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).  This course will cover how to analyse unstructured data, specifically data in plaintext files (TXT).  

The course will have four, one-hour, virtual tutorials.  

Participants will complete assignments in Jupyter Notebooks.  The instructor will provide learning material from freely available, online, resources. 

This is an **intermediate-level course**. Intermediate sessions explore specific aspects of the method (libraries, tools etc.) and offer a more in-depth understanding of the course topics, without introducing the basics. Some previous knowledge of Python and notebooks is required to be able to follow the content. 

To attend this course, you will have to join the associated Microsoft Teams group. 

The link to join the group will be sent to the attendees prior to the course start date, so please make sure to do so in advance. 

After taking part in this event, you may decide that you need some further help in applying what you have learnt to your research. If so, you can book a Data Surgery meeting with one of our training fellows.

### 1.3 Preparatory Email 
Good afternoon,     


You have registered as a participant for the upcoming course: **Text Analysis with Python’s NLTK Library**. 

The course will start **Monday 10/04** from **14:00-15:00** and will last **Monday 01/05**. 
 
Please carefully read the following notes regarding how to get ready for this course 

If you’re new to this training event format, or to CDCS training events in general, [read more on what to expect from CDCS training](https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/what-expect-cdcs-training). Here you will also find details of our cancellation and no-show policy, which applies to this event.     

The course will take place in the Digital Scholarship Centre Room. The room is located on the last floor of the Library. If you are accessing the 6th floor by the elevator the room will be located on your left past the wooden door.   

As of March 2022, the government formally removed all Covid restrictions in the UK. We ask that you continue to be considerate of others’ personal space, and please do not attend if you feel unwell or have any of Covid symptoms.

For this course, the instructor is going to use Python via **Google Colab**. 

If you are going to use Google Colab you do not need to install anything but you will need to set up on it up. Attached is the instruction on how to do so.

In the attached document there is also info on how to download Python via Anaconda and how to set it up in Noteable. Please notice that if you decide to use Noteable or run the notebook on your own machine you may encounter some problems in installing the libraries.


To share the course material and facilitate communications we have created a Teams Group. Please join the Teams via this link.  
All material will be shared via Teams in the “Files” tab of the “General” channel (you will not be able to access the materials without joining).  
We are going to share the Google Colab link in the Team group on Thursday.    

Best wishes, 

The CDCS Team 


## 2 Digital Method of the Month. "Text Analysis"

### 2.1 Structure
At our Method of the Month sessions, we discuss different digital research methods in depth. 
This is a great space to learn about new methods and find out about their associated benefits and pitfalls, and so to figure out if this method is suitable for your own research project. 

You will receive a document beforehand that will be used to direct the conversation and that you can use as a reference to start learning the method by yourself. 
We use the Team feature in Microsoft Teams, so you may be asked to join a Team in advance of the session in order to contact your instructor.

**ONLINE**

Have you seen a presentation on digital research methods and wondered if they are applicable to your work? Are you interested in learning new digital skills but unsure where to start? 

This is the right place for you!   

The digital method of the month meeting is a safe space to freely discuss the practicalities of learning and implementing a new digital skill in your research.   

Each month we select a method, and we have an honest and practical discussion on what it takes to learn and master it. How much time will it take to get the basics? What are the software options available? What are the most common pitfalls? Where can you find more info on the subject? Etc...    

The method of this month is Text Analysis, which allows for patterns in language to be studied on a large scale, enabling “distant reading” of books, magazines, newspapers, and other digitized texts. Join us to learn about the resources that the programming languages Python and R offer for text analysis. During the meeting, we’ll cover the basics of preparing a file (or collection of files) for text analysis, the types of questions that text analysis can answer, and the different tools you can use to answer those questions.   

This is a **beginner-level event**, and no previous knowledge of the method is required.  

To attend this event, **you will have to join the associated Microsoft Teams group**. 

The link to join the group will be sent to the attendees prior to the course start date, so please make sure to do so in advance.

## 3 Silent Disco. "Silent Disco: Introduction to Text Analysis" 

### 3.1 Structure
Our Silent Discos are usually asynchronous learning sessions. 

This means that when attending one, you will work through the tutorial at your own pace with an instructor available online to help you with any issues. 

We use the Team feature in Microsoft Teams, so you may be asked to join a Team in advance of the event in order to contact and get support from your instructor. 

Please note that for this type of asynchronous training, the video feed will not be used and all communications will be held via chat.

### 3.2 Training Page Content

**ONLINE**
The amount of textual data available to us grows each day, comprising a huge resource which is potentially of tremendous value. This workshop will introduce the process of extracting meaningful structured data and information from text.   

Participants will use Python and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for the retrieval of basic textual information such as:   

- Word frequencies   

- Plots of frequency distributions   

- Common word pairs   

- Part of Speech tagging 

The workshop will take place via Microsoft Teams in a ‘Silent Disco’ format. This is a self-paced event: when taking part, you will work through the tutorial at your own pace with an instructor available online to help you with any issues. 

This is an intermediate-level workshop. You will need a basic understanding of Python and how to run Python code. 

To attend this course, you will have to join the associated Microsoft Teams group. The link to join the group will be sent to attendees prior to the course start date, so please make sure to do so in advance. 

After taking part in this event, you may decide that you need some further help in applying what you have learnt to your research. If so, you can book a Data Surgery meeting with one of our training fellows.
