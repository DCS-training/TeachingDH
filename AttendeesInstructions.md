# Attendees Instructions
We will simulate three learning experiences using roleplay. The formats are as follows:

- **Standard workshop**: an instructor-led live coding tutorial in an introduction to the NLTK package in Python
- **Digital Method of the Month**: an open discussion about text mining as a method, including what it takes to get started, potential use cases, and resources for learning
- **Silent Disco**: an opportunity to receive real-time chat support while working through a Programming Historian lesson.

Below you can find all the information that an attendee will receive for each training format. 


## 1. Standard Training. "Text Analysis with Python’s NLTK Library"

### 1.1 Structure 
Courses are longer training events (usually two to five classes) and they are the most time-consuming type of training offered by the Centre. 

Please make sure you have the time to attend all the classes. 

There may be some preparation to do between classes and you will most likely be asked to install some software/packages beforehand. 

All the instructions on how to prepare will be sent to you by email prior to the first meeting. 

Our courses will run either in person or online. 

For the courses, we use the Team feature in Microsoft Teams, so you may be asked to join a Team in advance of the course in order to contact and get support from your instructor and to facilitate the sharing of the course material.

### 1.2 Training Page content

**IN PERSON**

This course is for **people who have some experience coding in Python** and would like to expand their capabilities to include the library Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).  This course will cover how to analyse unstructured data, specifically data in plaintext files (TXT).  

The course will have four, one-hour, tutorials.  

Participants will complete assignments in Jupyter Notebooks.  The instructor will provide learning material from freely available, online, resources. 

This is an **intermediate-level course**. Intermediate sessions explore specific aspects of the method (libraries, tools etc.) and offer a more in-depth understanding of the course topics, without introducing the basics. Some previous knowledge of Python and notebooks is required to be able to follow the content. 

To attend this course, you will have to join the associated Microsoft Teams group. 

The link to join the group will be sent to the attendees prior to the course start date, so please make sure to do so in advance. 

After taking part in this event, you may decide that you need some further help in applying what you have learnt to your research. If so, you can book a Data Surgery meeting with one of our training fellows.

## 2 Digital Method of the Month. "Text Analysis"

### 2.1 Structure
At our Method of the Month sessions, we discuss different digital research methods in depth. 
This is a great space to learn about new methods and find out about their associated benefits and pitfalls, and so to figure out if this method is suitable for your own research project. 

You will receive a document beforehand that will be used to direct the conversation and that you can use as a reference to start learning the method by yourself. 
We use the Team feature in Microsoft Teams, so you may be asked to join a Team in advance of the session in order to contact your instructor.

**ONLINE**

Have you seen a presentation on digital research methods and wondered if they are applicable to your work? Are you interested in learning new digital skills but unsure where to start? 

This is the right place for you!   

The digital method of the month meeting is a safe space to freely discuss the practicalities of learning and implementing a new digital skill in your research.   

Each month we select a method, and we have an honest and practical discussion on what it takes to learn and master it. How much time will it take to get the basics? What are the software options available? What are the most common pitfalls? Where can you find more info on the subject? Etc...    

The method of this month is Text Analysis, which allows for patterns in language to be studied on a large scale, enabling “distant reading” of books, magazines, newspapers, and other digitized texts. Join us to learn about the resources that the programming languages Python and R offer for text analysis. During the meeting, we’ll cover the basics of preparing a file (or collection of files) for text analysis, the types of questions that text analysis can answer, and the different tools you can use to answer those questions.   

This is a **beginner-level event**, and no previous knowledge of the method is required.  

To attend this event, **you will have to join the associated Microsoft Teams group**. 

The link to join the group will be sent to the attendees prior to the course start date, so please make sure to do so in advance.

## 3 Silent Disco. "Silent Disco: Introduction to Text Analysis" 

### 3.1 Structure
Our Silent Discos are usually asynchronous learning sessions. 

This means that when attending one, you will work through the tutorial at your own pace with an instructor available online to help you with any issues. 

We use the Team feature in Microsoft Teams, so you may be asked to join a Team in advance of the event in order to contact and get support from your instructor. 

Please note that for this type of asynchronous training, the video feed will not be used and all communications will be held via chat.

### 3.2 Training Page Content

**ONLINE**
The amount of textual data available to us grows each day, comprising a huge resource which is potentially of tremendous value. This workshop will introduce the process of extracting meaningful structured data and information from text.   

Participants will use Python and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for the retrieval of basic textual information such as:   

- Word frequencies   

- Plots of frequency distributions   

- Common word pairs   

- Part of Speech tagging 

The workshop will take place via Microsoft Teams in a ‘Silent Disco’ format. This is a self-paced event: when taking part, you will work through the tutorial at your own pace with an instructor available online to help you with any issues. 

This is an intermediate-level workshop. You will need a basic understanding of Python and how to run Python code. 

To attend this course, you will have to join the associated Microsoft Teams group. The link to join the group will be sent to attendees prior to the course start date, so please make sure to do so in advance. 

After taking part in this event, you may decide that you need some further help in applying what you have learnt to your research. If so, you can book a Data Surgery meeting with one of our training fellows.
